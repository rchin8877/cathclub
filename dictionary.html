                            <td> Combines cardiac resynchronisation with an ICD. The CRT is essentially a <strong>biventricular pacemaker</strong> - delivers biventricular pacing to synchronize the contractions of the left and right ventricles. The <strong>ICD</strong> monitors the heart for life-threatening arrhythmias, such as VF, and delivers electric shocks to restore a normal rhythm.

                            <td> Similar to FFR, DFR measures coronary pressure to assess stenosis severity; however, it is performed at rest, <strong>without the need for adenosine or hyperemia induced</strong>. Unlike FFR, which evaluates pressure across the entire cardiac cycle, DFR is measured only during diastole, when <strong>resting flow rate</strong> is most stable.

                            <td> Procedure used to <strong>restore a normal heart rhythm</strong> in pts with arrhythmias, such as AF, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It can be performed electrically or chemically (with medications)! Cardioversion is synchronised whereas defibrillation is unsynchronized and used for life-threatening arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, pulseless VT). <br> 
                            May be used before ablation since a normal rhythm is necessary to properly map the hearts electrical activity or to safely position catheters, as well as after ablating to confirm the effectiveness of the ablation.
